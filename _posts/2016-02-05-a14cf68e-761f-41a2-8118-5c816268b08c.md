I must study **politics and war** so that my sons may have liberty to study **mathematics and philosophy**. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study **painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain. **

**- John Adams**
